## An Ansible playbook to launch a website on a docker container.

Here I am using Redhat 8 as my Controller Node and worker node. In this Playbook I've setuped Apache Httpd over a centos container and write a basic website to say " Hi From Docker Container"

Here is the ansible playbook to launch a website on a docker container.
